{"name":"BarFiller","tagline":"An Experience Bar that shows your characters level progress.","body":"### Welcome to BarFiller.\r\nWhat does it do? Simply put, it displays an experience bar above the [Help Window](http://www.playonline.com/ff11/manual/index.html?loc=en#040100). It will display at the top-center of the screen no matter what resolution you're using, and display your current level progress below. Includes XP needed to reach the next level, overall %, and XP/hr.\r\n\r\nSince it shares much of the code from _PointWatch_, you can quickly update the experience counter by opening your Status menu, and/or waiting for any experience to be gained, or lost.\r\n\r\nAvailable commands:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbarfiller help - Shows the following information below\r\nbarfiller clear - Resets exp counter to 0\r\nbarfiller reload - Turns itself off, and on again\r\nbarfiller unload - Disables addon completely\r\n```\r\n\r\nShortcuts for **Console** and **//Chat Window**:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbf h   |   //bf h\r\nbf c   |   //bf c\r\nbf r   |   //bf r\r\nbf u   |   //bf u\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Thanks to\r\n@Byrth for the _PointWatch_ addon, and maintainer @SnickySnacks. @sm111 on parsing packets. @Arcon, and @IryokuChevalier for helping debug, clean up the code, better logic structure, and overall great feedback.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFound a bug, want to request new features, or yell at me? You can reach me best on the [Windower Forums](http://forums.windower.net/index.php?/topic/807-barfiller/), or on the FFOChat IRC channel (irc.ffochat.com).","google":"UA-63482911-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
